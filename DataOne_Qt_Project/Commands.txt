A. Telnet Clients (ports 2233, 3322, and server connection)

	1.	ping dd.MM.yyyy hh:mm:ss.zzz
	
			dd = Day
			MM = Month
			yyyy = Year
		
			hh = Hour
			mm = Minutes
			ss = Seconds
			zzz = Milliseconds
		
		Output: Upon receiving this command, DataOne application compares the date and time to its local current time.
				If, there is a difference of more than 1 second, application will generate a "message 80 x seconds\r\n" response to the sending client.
				If DataOne application receives a manual time update via "set_date_time" command, time comparison will not be done, and command will be ignored.
		
				This command can also be issued without the date and time. In this case, the command will be ignored.
