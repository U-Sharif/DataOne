How to get started with development ?
-------------------------------------

1.  Please read "How to - Impinj Dev Environment with Qt Framework.pdf" in the project filder
    for step-by-step guide to setting up the development environment.


2. Skim through the following files in the project folder:

        Embedded_Developers_Guide.pdf
        LTK_Programmers_Guide.pdf
        Octane_LLRP.pdf
        RevolutionInstallGuide.pdf
        RShell_Reference_Manual_4-8-0.pdf
        SpeedwayR_installation_and_operations_guide_4-8-0.pdf


3.  DataOne application architecture:

        MainThread
            |
            |
            |-DataOneSettings (Object)
            |
            |-SystemMonitor (Thread)
            |
            |-ConsoleFileWriter (Thread)
            |
            |-Reader (Object)
            |
            |-GPIOHandler (Thread)
            |
            |-TcpConsoleServer (Object) -----------> TcpConsoleClient (n Threads)
            |
            |-TcpDataServer (Object) --------------> TcpTelnetClient (n Threads)
            |
            |-TcpFilteredServer (Object) ----------> TcpTelnetClient (n Threads)
            |                                   |
            |-DataFileWriter (Thread)           ---> TcpServerConnection (2 Threads)
            |
            |-FilteredFileWriter Thread)


4. Read the header files of each class in this project to understand the functionality.

5. Go through the header files of OctaneSDK to understand the LLRP interface.

6. Good to go.
